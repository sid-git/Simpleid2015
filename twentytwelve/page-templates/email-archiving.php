                        <p class="">The volume of email produced by your business is continuing to rise. At the same time, industry regulations and legal risks are compelling you to retain your business communications in perpetuity. Simple iD’s cloud-based Email Archiving provides the perfect solution for the institutional knowledge contained in your email. All regulated businesses—including financial, healthcare, insurance, retail, and other industries—are required to archive email by a variety of compliance mandates. The incremental cost of inadequate email archiving can quickly escalate into tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars.
